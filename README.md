Project Name: Baby’s First Learning

Introduction:
Children are in the midst of a vast, unplanned experiment, surrounded by digital technologies that were not available but 5 years ago. Mobile touchscreen technologies also referred to as tablet technologies are revolutionising the interactive digital experiences of young children . Owing to the growing inclusion of touchscreens, Babies children explore and learn with mobile devices in ways that are natural to them. The reason is that touchscreen devices (tablets) are designed in such a way that even very baby users can use them. Early research findings show that children younger than 2 years old can play and learn using mobile devices and/or multitouch displays . Other studies revealed that children as young as two will naturally interact with a touchscreen, in the same way they will use natural instincts to play with a new toy. A study across Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Britain found more 2–5-year-olds are able to manipulate apps than tie their shoelaces or ride a bike . Preschool children do not need to develop the manual handling skills to use a separate keyboard and mouse required by general-purpose computers in order to gain access to interactive content designed specifically for them .At its best, touchscreen technology offers a mode of interactive experience that mirrors the child’s natural constructivist learning .Ideally, smart devices accompanying applications (apps) can create exciting and effective learning environments for learning and instruction in early .Developers are increasingly creating educational apps that target this age group .


Problem Statement:
The years before a child reaches kindergarten are among the most critical in his or her life to influence learning. Early childhood is a crucial time period for the development of the mental functions of children. Nowadays kids are very advance as they are exposed to world with high technology. However parents or guardians cannot expect them to learn
using the traditional ways as how the previous generation used to learn. So in this case I would like to propose a special learning system which could be interactive and also provide convenience and mobility to the user. Early childhood learning is significant to the emergence of the abilities and skills in areas such as language, motor skills, psychosocial cognitive and learning, is now known to be greatly influenced by exogenous factors, including the nature of the educational environment to which the child is exposed during the first 3to 6 years of life.
